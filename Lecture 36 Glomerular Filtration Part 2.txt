Lecture 36 Glomerular Filtration Part 2
1) Explain the clearance principle.
2) Use the clearance equation and an appropriate compound to estimate the “Effective Renal Flow”. How would you determine the RBF and PAH clearance?
3) What are the requirements for a solute to be effective in measuring GFR?
4) Explain how GFR may be measured with Inulin and Creatinine. What are the disadvantages of using these substances?
5) Explain the use of the inverse relationship between plasma creatinine and the GFR and show how this may be used to estimate GFR.
6) Be aware of other methods to calculate or estimate GFR.
