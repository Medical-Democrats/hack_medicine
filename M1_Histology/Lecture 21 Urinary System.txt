Urinary System
Learning Objectives
1. Identify histologically and understand the  following terms: kidney hilus, cortex, medulla, papilla, pelvis, calyx, pyramid, medullary ray, nephron, cortical nephron, juxtamedullary nephron, afferent and efferent arterioles, renal corpuscle, glomerulus, filtration basal lamina, Bowman's capsule, vascular and urinary poles, urinary space, Podocyte, pedicels, filtration slits,  mesangial cells, capillary fenestrations, PAS stain of glomerulus, proximal and distal convoluted tubules, brush border and basal mitochondria of proximal convoluted tubules, proximal straight and distal straight tubules, thin descending loop, thick ascending loop of Henle, Macula densa, juxtaglomerular apparatus, collecting tubules and ducts, podocyte, arcuate and interlobular arteries and veins, peritubular plexus, vasa recta, arcuate and interlobular arteries and veins, transitional epithelium, ureter, urinary bladder, urethra (proximal versus distal).
2. Identify and describe the renal histological structures responsible for the following: a) filtration of blood plasma; b) reabsorption of 70% of the water;  c) reabsorption of protein, peptides and sugars; d) removal of water from the cortex;  e) active transport of sodium; f) Juxtaglomerular apparatus control of blood pressure;  i) ADH (anti-diuretic hormone control of water reabsorption.
3. Distinguish histological differences between urethra, urinary bladder and ureter.
4. Trace a water molecule through the kidney starting in the renal artery and ending in the ureter; select a pathway depending upon whether it is a superficial nephron or a juxtamedulary nephron.
5. Trace a water molecule through the kidney starting in the renal artery and ending in the renal vein, having gone through the proximal convoluted tubule of a juxtamedulary nephron
