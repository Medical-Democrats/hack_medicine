Neurocytology
Learning Objectives
1. Recognize and name the parts of a neuron and correlate with function (axon, Nissl body, nucleus, nucleolus, axon hillock, mitochondrion, dendrite, neurofilaments, microtubules, Golgi, lipofuscin, synapse)
2. Distinguish neuron from neuroglial cell and understand the difference in neuron classes
3. Name the neuroglial cell types and understand their functions (do not recognize the different types in light microscopy but know neuroglial versus neuron by microscopy)
4. Recognize myelin sheath and understand its contribution to nerve function
5. Understand the difference between oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell and recognize both with electron microscopy
6. Recognize white versus gray matter in central and peripheral nervous system
7. Recognize cerebellum; Purkinje cells; dendrite area and granular small neurons
8. Recognize cerebrum, nerve cell bodies, glial cells and capillaries
9. Understand and recognize epineurium, perineurium, endoneurium, in relationship to Schwann cells and the axons
10. Understand and recognize peripheral nerve ganglia and their associated nerve tracts
11. Understand and recognize the motor end plate
12. Recognize a taste bud and Meissners or Pacinian corpuscles
