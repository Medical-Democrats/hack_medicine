Cells & Organelles II

Objectives

1. Actin filaments, subunits = G-actin
2. Microtubules, subunits = tubulin
3. Intermediate filaments, subunits = variety of related intermediate filament protiens, e.g. keratin, nestin, neurofilaments
4. Self-assembly
5. Polarity  
    a. Of filaments  
    b. Of cells  
6. Nucleation, elongation  
    a. Arp2/3 complex, gamma-Tubulin complex  
    b. Protein aggregation disease
7. Role of ATP hydrolysis (actin) and GTP hydrolysis (tubulin)
8. Drugs that stabilize and destabilize filaments
