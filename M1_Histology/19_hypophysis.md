Hypophysis-Hypothalamus-Pineal Gland

Learning Objectives
1. Endocrine gland organization: discrete organs or portions of organs
2. Classes of hormones and features of the cells that produce them
3. Gross anatomical organization of the hypothalamus, optic chiasma, hypophysis (pituitary), and hypothalamohypophyseal system
4. Organization of the pituitary: neurohypophysis, adenohypophysis
5. Major divisions of the neurophypophysis (posterior pituitary)
a. Pars nervosa
b. Infundibulum (neurostalk)
c. Median eminence
6. Major divisions of the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary)
a. pars distalis
b. pars tuberalis
c. pars intermedia
7. Major cell types of the pituitary; their locations; hormones and target organs
a. distribution of chromophobes, acidophils and basophils
b. How to recognize these cells
8. Histological differences between posterior and anterior pituitary
a. Nerve fibers, pituicytes and Herring bodies versus high vascularity, irregular cords or epithelial endocrine cells
9. Accumulation of peptide hormones in axon terminals of the neurohypophysis.
