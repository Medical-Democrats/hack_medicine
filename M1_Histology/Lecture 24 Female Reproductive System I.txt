Female Reproductive System I

Learning Objectives
1. Understand the histology of the ovary, including the following: cortex and medulla; mesothelium; primordial, primary (unilaminar and multilaminar), secondary (antral) and tertiary (Graffian) follicles; granulosa cells; Theca (interna and externa) cells; corpus luteum; oocyte (nucleus, cytoplasm, zona pellucida); corona radiata; cumulus oophorus; antrum follicular fluid.
2. Understand the number of follicles that develop.
3. Understand the difference between male and female development of germ cells in utero versus post birth; mitosis and meiosis in male and female gonads.
4. Describe ovulation histology; oocyte + corona radiata; corpus hemorragicum.
5. Describe the origin and histology of the corpus luteum, and its ultimate fate; granulosa lutein and Theca lutein cells.
6. Understand the major hormones of and the ovary and the cell types that produce them; cells and hormones of the corpus luteum and hormones that stimulate the CL
7. Understand the histology of the female reproductive tract (uterine tube), including the following: oviduct and arrangement of oviductal mucosa, Infundibulum, ampulla, isthmus; ciliated versus secretory cells; cervix epithelium and glands; vaginal epithelium
8. Understand the location of fertilization; the size of blastocysts; function of cilia; function of smooth muscle; endocrine regulation of cervix
9. Understand the Papanicolaou stain for cervical cancer
10. Describe the histology of uterine endometrium and myometrium and changes associated with hormones during the cyclical changes in function of this organ; uterine gland; spiral arteries
11. Understand histological changes associated with the menstrual, proliferative and secretory phases of the endometrial cycle
12. Understand the basics of blastocyst formation; trophoblasts; inner cell mass; embryonic stem cells
13. Understand the histology of implantation, formation of the placenta and maintenance of the pregnancy; when blastocysts invade the endometrial epithelium; cytotrophoblasts; syncytiotrophoblasts; lacunae and maternal blood; chorion, chorionic cavity; chorionic villi; placental barrier components
14. Understand the histology of the maternal side of placenta; the decidua, decidua basalis; decidual cells; cotyledons; decidua parietalis; spiral arteries and blood flow
15. Understand the histology of mammary gland, inactive and active; adipose tissue; lactiferous ducts; secretory lobules and alveoli; alveolar epithelial cells and lipid vacuoles; myoepithelial cell; immune cells; types of secretion.
