21_Hypercoagulopathy

Objectives

* Classify primary and secondary hypercoagulable states.
* List the common laboratory tests usually used for the initial work-up of coagulopathies and describe each noting the state of coagulation it assesses, the disorders in which it is abnormal, and its use in monitoring anticoagulation therapy.

Learning Tasks

1. Describe thrombosis based on site, etiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, and associated disorders.
2. Describe the association of thrombosis and cancer, its etiology and pathogenesis.
3. Define Trousseau Syndrome based on clinical features and laboratory findings.
4. Describe the following types of thrombosis:
	* Heparin-induced
	* lupus anticoagulant (LAC)
	* Anticardiolipin antibody associated
	* Coumadin-induced
5. Describe the tests included in the recommended hypercoagulation panel.
6. Identify the relative frequency of sites of thrombosis seen in hereditary deficiency of antithrombin.
7. Classify antithrombin deficiencies and describe their molecular basis.
8. Classify Protein C deficiencies and describe their molecular basis.
9. Classify Protein S deficiencies and describe their molecular basis.
10. Describe hereditary resistance of Factor V.
11. Describe the following and their role in thrombosis:
	* Prothrombin 20210 G to A
	* Homocysteine
	* Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL)
	* Normal Pregnancy
12. Outline an evaluation of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) including appropriate testing and the timing of that testing.
13. List and describe some of the novel anticoagulants.
14. Outline a traditional treatment scheme for thrombosis.
