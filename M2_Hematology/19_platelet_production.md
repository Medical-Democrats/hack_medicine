19_Platelet Production

Objectives

* List the common laboratory tests usually used for the initial work-up of coagulopathies and describe each noting the state of coagulation it assesses, the disorders in which it is abnormal, and its use in monitoring anticoagulation therapy.
* Discuss the clinical findings associated with various types of hemostatic defects, e.g. associated with platelet disorders, deep muscle and soft tissue bleeding associated with coagulation abnormalities, including symptoms, signs, etiology, laboratory findings, treatment, and prognosis.

Learning Tasks

1. Review the coagulation system.
2. Review the production of platelets including precursor cells and production stimulation/regulation.
3. Interpret platelet counts and predict the sequelae from abnormal results (high or low).
4. Describe the tests used to measure platelet function and interpret results from those tests.
5. Solve clinical scenarios based on platelet dysfunction utilizing clinical presentation and laboratory results.
6. Propose treatment options for platelet disorders.
