24_Bleeding Disorders

Objectives

* List the common laboratory tests usually used for the initial work-up of coagulopathies and describe each noting the state of coagulation it assesses, the disorders in which it is abnormal, and its use in monitoring anticoagulation therapy.
* Discuss the clinical findings associated with various types of hemostatic defects, e.g. associated with platelet disorders, deep muscle and soft tissue bleeding associated with coagulation abnormalities, including symptoms, signs, etiology, laboratory findings, treatment, and prognosis.

Learning Tasks

1. Review the mechanism of coagulation.
2. Describe the platelet function screening tests.
3. List the tests involved in an evaluation of hemostasis and explain what each test evaluates.
4. Utilize coagulation study results to derive a differential diagnosis for a patient with a coagulation abnormality.
5. Describe coagulation issues associated with the newborn.
6. Describe the various platelet disorders and classify them as congenital or acquired, and quantitative or qualitative.
7. Describe NAIT based on pathogenesis, etiology, genetics, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, laboratory findings, staging, associated features, treatment, prognosis, and sequelae.
8. Describe Hemophilia based on pathogenesis, etiology, genetics, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, laboratory findings, staging, associated features, treatment, prognosis, and sequelae.
9. Describe vonWillebrand disease based on pathogenesis, etiology, genetics, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, laboratory findings, staging, associated features, treatment, prognosis, and sequelae.
