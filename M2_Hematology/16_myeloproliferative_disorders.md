16_Myeloproliferative Disorders

Objectives

* Define myelodysplastic syndromes.
* Identify the symptoms, signs, potential causes, diagnostic tests, clinical and pathological findings, classifications, laboratory findings, associated features, treatment, and prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes including polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, and chronic myelogenous leukemia .
* Describe the usual peripheral blood presentation in myelodysplasia and describe associated bone marrow findings. Discuss the expected clinical course and identify major prognostic factors.
* Compare and contrast the following disorders: chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (P. vera), primary myelofibrosis, and essential thrombocythemia (ET) in terms of clinical features and presentation, peripheral blood and bone marrow findings, other laboratory findings, cytogenetics, complications and clinical course.
* Discuss clinical and laboratory features useful in differentiating a myeloproliferative disorder from a leukemoid reaction. Compare and contrast polycythemia vera, relative polycytehmia, and secondary polycythemia in terms of etiology and diagnostic criteria.

Learning Tasks

2. Define myeloproliferative disorders and list the major types.
3. Describe polycythemia vera based on pathogenesis, etiology, genetics, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, laboratory findings, staging, associated features, treatment, prognosis, and sequelae.
4. Describe primary or essential thrombocytopenia based on pathogenesis, etiology, genetics, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, laboratory findings, staging, associated features, treatment, prognosis, and sequelae.
5. Describe chronic myelogenous leukemia based on pathogenesis, etiology, genetics, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, laboratory findings, staging, associated features, treatment, prognosis, and sequelae.
6. Interpret clinical scenarios to develop a differential diagnosis which includes myeloproliferative disorders.
