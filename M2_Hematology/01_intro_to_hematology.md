01_Intro to Hematology

Objectives

* Describe the process of hematopoiesis and the perturbations in this process that lead to microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Describe the epidemiology, genetics, etiology, classification, clinical presentation, imaging, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, complications, and prognosis of microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.

Learning Tasks

1. Outline the course and provide an overview of hematology
2. Review red cell physiology, maturation, and precursors.
3. Discuss and describe the function of the hematopoietic cytokines including their activity and redundancy
4. Identify the sources of blood cell production based on the age of the individual
5. Review white cell physiology, maturation, and precursors.
6. Identify the cellular components of blood including normally appearing cells, their precursors and abnormally appearing cells.
7. Identify and review the major components of coagulation.
8. Define the following terms, recognize the abbreviations, state the units, and recall the normal ranges for each:
	* Complete blood count (CBC)
	* Hemoglobin (Hb or Hgb)
	* Hematocrit (Hct or crit)
	* Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
	* Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)
	* Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)
	* Red cell distribution width (RDW)
	* Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (Polys)
	* Segmented neutrophils (segs)
	* Lymphocytes (lymphs)
	* Monocytes (monos)
	* Basophils (basos)
	* Reticulocyte count (Retic)
	* Corrected reticulocyte count
	* Reticulocyte production index (RPI)
9. Define anemia and list the causes of anemia based on:
	* Decrease production
	* Increased destruction
	* MCV (micro-, normo- and macrocytic)
