05_Hematopoiesis Myelodysplastic

Objectives

* Describe the process of hematopoiesis and the perturbations in this process that lead to microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Define myelodysplastic syndromes.
* Beginning with an undifferentiated, pluripotent stem cell, draw a diagram of normal hematopoiesis and describe factors which influence erythropoiesis, granulopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis. List cells normally found in the peripheral blood, detailing subtypes of leukocytes. Compare the reporting of leukocyte differential counts as relative percentages versus absolute numbers, in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of each system.

Learning Tasks

1. Define the following terms:
	* Hematopoiesis
	* Lymphopoiesis
	* Myelopoiesis
	* Erythropoiesis
	* Thrombopoiesis
	* Pluipotent hematopoietic cell
2. Recall the sequence of proliferation and differentiation of stem cell into mature blood cells.
3. Identify each cell found in the sequence of hematopoiesis.
4. Discuss the various sites of hematopoiesis.
5. Define myelodysplastic syndromes.
6. Identify the symptoms, signs, potential causes, diagnostic tests, clinical and pathological findings, classifications, treatment, and prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes.
