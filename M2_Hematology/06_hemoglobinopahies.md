06_Hemoglobinopathies I & II

Objectives

* Describe the process of hematopoiesis and the perturbations in this process that lead to microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Describe the epidemiology, genetics, etiology, classification, clinical presentation, imaging, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, complications, and prognosis of microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Interpret historical, exam, laboratory (especially complete blood count and peripheral blood smear findings), and radiological findings to develop a differential diagnosis and ultimately a most likely diagnosis of case-based scenarios related to anemia including microcytic, macrocytic, normocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Compare and contrast hemolytic anemias, including blood smear morphology, patients at risk, clinical findings, and how laboratory testing may differentiate them. Explain why not all patients with hemolytic anemia are anemic.

Learning Tasks

1. Review normal RBC structure and function.
2. Review normal hemoglobin structure, function, and physiology.
3. Describe the genetic mechanisms for abnormal hemoglobins.
4. Describe the following hemoglobinopathies based on etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, laboratory findings, imaging, treatment, sequalae, and prognosis:
	* Methemoglobinemia
	* a-Thalassemia
	* b-Thalassemia
	* Sickle cell and Sickling Disorders
5. Recognize the various clinical presentations of hemoglobinopathies and differentiate them from other commonly occurring medical and surgical diseases.
