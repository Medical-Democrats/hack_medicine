17_CML

Objectives

* Define and classify acute and chronic leukemias based on their pathophysiology, epidemiology, genetics, risk factors, morphological findings, immunophenotype, clinical findings, disease course, and prognosis.
* Identify the management options for acute and chronic leukemias including effectiveness, a timeline for effectiveness, goals of treatment, prognosis, risks and benefits of treatment.
* Compare and contrast: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in terms of: incidence and age distribution, cytogenetics, morphology (bone marrow and peripheral blood), immunophenotyping, laboratory diagnosis (including cytochemical stains), clinical features, prognosis.

Learning Tasks
1. Identify the epidemiological data related to CML.
2. Recognize that CML is a subtype of myeloproliferative disorders.
3. Explain the genetics associate with CML.
4. Describe the clinical presentation (symptoms, signs and lab findings) associated with the diagnosis of CML.
5. Describe the phases of CML.
6. List a differential diagnosis for CML.
7. Describe the prognosis for CML and recognize poor prognostic factors. 
8. Outline treatment options (including mechanisms of action for drugs used) for CML
