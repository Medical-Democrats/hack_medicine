12_Hematopathology Lab I_Red Cell Disorders, etc

Objectives

* Given CBC data, state whether the patient is anemic, how severe the anemia is, and whether it is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic. List clinical signs and symptoms associated with that degree of anemia. Determine if any quantitative abnormalities of white cells or platelets are present, and give the medical terms that would describe the abnormalities. List clinical signs and symptoms that might be expected.
* Beginning with an undifferentiated, pluripotent stem cell, draw a diagram of normal hematopoiesis and describe factors which influence erythropoiesis, granulopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis. List cells normally found in the peripheral blood, detailing subtypes of leukocytes. Compare the reporting of leukocyte differential counts as relative percentages versus absolute numbers, in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of each system.
* Define a leukocyte left shift and list at least three benign or reactive causes. Contrast expected peripheral blood findings in a patient with acute bacterial infection versus a patient with viral infection. Describe bone marrow failure and discuss potential etiologic factors. Describe symptoms associated with neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. List the major etiology and pathogenesis of leukopenia, leukemoid reaction, neutropenia, lymphocytosis, left shift, reactive lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, monocytosis, basophilia and leukoerythroblastic reaction.
* List from memory at least 4 causes for microcytic anemia. Compare and contrast these disorders, including patients at risk, clinical course, and how laboratory tests can distinguish them.
* List from memory at least 4 causes of macrocytic anemia. Compare and contrast them, including blood smear findings, patients at risk, clinical presentation, and how laboratory testing can distinguish them.
* Compare and contrast hemolytic anemias, including blood smear morphology, patients at risk, clinical findings, and how laboratory testing may differentiate them. Explain why not all patients with hemolytic anemia are anemic.
* Discuss aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, and agranulocytosis, including causes, clinical and laboratory findings, and findings on bone marrow examination.
