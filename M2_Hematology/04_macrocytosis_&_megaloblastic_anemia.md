04_Macrocytosis & Megaloblastic Anemia

Objectives

* Describe the process of hematopoiesis and the perturbations in this process that lead to microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Describe the epidemiology, genetics, etiology, classification, clinical presentation, imaging, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, complications, and prognosis of microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Interpret historical, exam, laboratory (especially complete blood count and peripheral blood smear findings), and radiological findings to develop a differential diagnosis and ultimately a most likely diagnosis of case-based scenarios related to anemia including microcytic, macrocytic, normocytic, and hemolytic anemias.

Learning Tasks

1. Define macrocytic and megalobastic anemia.
2. Identify the causes, pathology, clinical presentation, and systemic manifestations related to macrocytic anemias.
3. Solve clinical scenarios related to macrocytic anemias based on history, physical exam, imaging, and lab findings.
4. Discuss the treatment options for various types of macrocytic anemias.
