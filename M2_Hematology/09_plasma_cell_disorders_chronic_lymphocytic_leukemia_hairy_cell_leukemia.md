09_Plasma Cell Dis, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Hairy Cell Leukemia

Objectives
 
* Compare and contrast, monoclonal gammopathy of unknown clinical significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia with regard to clinical presentation, laboratory findings, peripheral blood and bone marrow morphology, radiographic findings, diagnostic tests and clinical course. 
* List the two main causes of mortality in patients with multiple myeloma and tell why they occur.
* Compare and contrast chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in terms of: incidence and age distribution, cytogenetics, morphology (bone marrow and peripheral blood), immunophenotyping, laboratory diagnosis (including cytochemical stains), clinical features, prognosis.
 
Learning Tasks

1. Explain the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of each of the following features of multiple myeloma:
	* “myeloma kidney”
	* increased susceptibility to infection
	* hemorrhagic diatheses
	* skeletal lesions
	* neurologic complications
	* hyperviscosity syndrome
2. Describe the laboratory tests that are useful in the identification and quantitation of monoclonal proteins in serum and urine. Explain the principle, interpretation and reliability of each. Describe the types and frequencies of monoclonal proteins found in patients with multiple myeloma, and explain the prognostic significance of each.
3. Describe the clinical and laboratory features of Waldenström macroglobulinemia and of heavy chain disease. Explain the pathophysiology of each, and compare them with multiple myeloma and malignant lymphoma.
4. For each disease process:
	* describe the peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph node, and splenic findings.
	* describe the immunologic markers.
	* describe the pathophysiology and pathobiology.
