20_Coagulation

Objectives

* List the common laboratory tests usually used for the initial work-up of coagulopathies and describe each noting the state of coagulation it assesses, the disorders in which it is abnormal, and its use in monitoring anticoagulation therapy.

Learning Tasks

1. Review the coagulation system and the function of each component.
2. Describe the coagulation cascade (intrinsic and extrinsic pathways).
3. Explain the fibrinolytic systems and intrinsic anticoagulants.
4. Interpret coagulation lab results, categorize those results as normal and abnormal, and describe the effects of medications on the coagulation system.
5. Solve clinical scenarios based on coagulation abnormalities utilizing clinical presentation and laboratory results.
6. Review coagulation and the regulation of thrombin generation.
7. Review platelet function screening tests.
8. Describe each test used to evaluate hemostasis.
9. Interpret abnormal coagulation test results including prolonged aPTT and/or PT.
10. Describe the normal coagulation findings of a newborn.
11. Describe the various inherited platelet function disorders.
12. Describe neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia NAIT including platelet alloangtigens, epidemiology, clinical presentation, laboratory testing, treatment, and recommendations to parents for future pregnancies.
13. Solve clinical scenarios based on problems with hemostasis.
14. Describe hemophilia based on epidemiology, genetics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, treatment, and prognosis.
15. Describe vonWillebrand disease based on epidemiology, genetics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, treatment, and prognosis.
