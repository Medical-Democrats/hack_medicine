08_Path of Nonneoplastic Lymphoid Disorders

Objectives
 
* Define and list potential causes of lymphadenopathy. Describe the proper submission of a lymph node biopsy to the surgical pathology for evaluation of a suspected lymphoproliferative disorder
* Discuss Langerhans cell histiocytosis in terms of:
	* Definition
	* classification
	* clinicopathologic diagnosis
	* morphology
            
	and for each type, discuss:
		* age of onset
		* distribution of lesions
		* clinical course/prognosis
*Classify major causes of changes in size of spleen, in terms of both increase and decrease, and list the major complications of splenomegaly
* Briefly describe the morphologic features, clinical presentation, associated conditions, course and prognosis in thymic hyperplasia and thymoma.
