25_Abnormalities of Platelets

Objectives

* Discuss the clinical findings associated with various types of hemostatic defects, e.g. associated with platelet disorders, deep muscle and soft tissue bleeding associated with coagulation abnormalities, including symptoms, signs, etiology, laboratory findings, treatment, and prognosis.
* Define Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), TTP and HUS including laboratory features and name some of the pathogenetic mechanisms proposed to explain its development and some of the clinical conditions associated with these conditions.

Learning Tasks
1. Describe the various platelet disorders and classify them as congenital or acquired, and quantitative or qualitative.
2. Describe the clinical features associated with low platelets.
3. Interpret platelet counts based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings and determine the likelihood of bleeding.
4. Define and explain pseudothrombocytopenia.
5. List the causes of thrombocytopenia and classify them based on decreased production, immune destruction, or non-immune destruction.
6. List the antibodies directed against platelets.
7. Outline the diagnostic process to determine the etiology of various platelet disorders.
8. List the causes of drug-induced thrombocytopenia, explain the pathogenesis, and list treatment options.
9. Outline a treatment protocol for heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
10. Describe the mode of action for each drug used to treat heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
11. Describe thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) based on etiology, pathogenesis, pathology, risk factors, clinical findings, laboratory findings, prognosis, and treatment.
12. Describe hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) based on etiology, pathogenesis, pathology, risk factors, clinical findings, laboratory findings, prognosis, and treatment.
13. Describe thrombocytopenia of pregnancy and pre-eclampsia including the HELLP syndrome based on etiology, pathogenesis, pathology, risk factors, clinical findings, laboratory findings, prognosis, and treatment.
14. Describe thrombocytopenia associated with the following diseases:
	* Hemophilia
	* HIV
	* Hypersplenism

	based on etiology, pathogenesis, pathology, risk factors, clinical findings, laboratory findings, prognosis, and treatment.
15. List the causes of acquired platelet dysfunction and classify them as defective adhesion, defective primary aggregation, defective platelet release, release mechanism defects, and drug-induced.
16. Describe the congenital disorders of platelets based on etiology, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and treatment.
17. Define thrombocytosis, list the various causes, and outline a treatment plan.
18. Describe acute and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) based on etiology, clinical presentation course, laboratory findings, associated disorders, prognosis, and therapy.
19. Describe ITP of pregnancy based on etiology, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, prognosis (mother and fetus), and treatment.
20. List a differential diagnosis for thrombocytopenia and large platelets and describe each disease listed.
