03_Iron Deficiency Anemia & Anemia of Chronic Dis.

Objectives

* Describe the process of hematopoiesis and the perturbations in this process that lead to microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Describe the epidemiology, genetics, etiology, classification, clinical presentation, imaging, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, complications, and prognosis of microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Interpret historical, exam, laboratory (especially complete blood count and peripheral blood smear findings), and radiological findings to develop a differential diagnosis and ultimately a most likely diagnosis of case-based scenarios related to anemia including microcytic, macrocytic, normocytic, and hemolytic anemias.

Learning Tasks

1. Review elemental iron, its properties, sources, and its uses in biological systems.
2. Recall the total body content of iron and which compartments it appears.
3. Review the iron transport systems including absorption, transportation, and transferrin.
4. Define iron deficiency anemia based on findings on the CBC including the peripheral smear and in the bone marrow, prevalence, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings.
5. List causes of false negative serum ferritin results in iron deficiency anemia.
6. Outline the treatment and risks to treatment of iron deficiency anemia.
7. Define anemia of chronic disorders based on findings on the CBC including the peripheral smear and in the bone marrow, prevalence, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings.
8. Discuss the diagnostic strategy when evaluating for anemia of chronic disease.
9. Outline a treatment strategy for anemia of chronic disease.
