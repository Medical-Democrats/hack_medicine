Objectives

* Describe the process of hematopoiesis and the perturbations in this process that lead to microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Interpret historical, exam, laboratory (especially complete blood count and peripheral blood smear findings), and radiological findings to develop a differential diagnosis and ultimately a most likely diagnosis of case-based scenarios related to anemia including microcytic, macrocytic, normocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Describe the epidemiology, genetics, etiology, classification, clinical presentation, imaging, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, complications, and prognosis of aplastic anemia.
* Define and classify acute and chronic leukemias based on their pathophysiology, epidemiology, genetics, risk factors, morphological findings, immunophenotype, clinical findings, disease course, and prognosis.
* Identify the management options for acute and chronic leukemias including effectiveness, a timeline for effectiveness, goals of treatment, prognosis, risks and benefits of treatment.
* Describe the epidemiology, genetics, etiology, classification, clinical presentation, imaging, laboratory findings, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, staging and grading, treatment, complications, and prognosis of Hodgkins, non-Hodgkins, large cell, follicular, mantle cell, and MALT lymphomas.
* Describe the epidemiology, genetics, etiology, classification, clinical presentation, laboratory studies, imaging, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, complications, and prognosis of multiple myeloma and plasma cell disorders.
* Define myelodysplastic syndromes.
