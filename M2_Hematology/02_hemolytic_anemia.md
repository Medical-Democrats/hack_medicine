02_Hemolytic Anemia

Objectives

* Describe the process of hematopoiesis and the perturbations in this process that lead to microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Describe the epidemiology, genetics, etiology, classification, clinical presentation, imaging, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, complications, and prognosis of microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic, and hemolytic anemias.
* Interpret historical, exam, laboratory (especially complete blood count and peripheral blood smear findings), and radiological findings to develop a differential diagnosis and ultimately a most likely diagnosis of case-based scenarios related to anemia including microcytic, macrocytic, normocytic, and hemolytic anemias.

Learning Tasks

1. Describe the symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings found in patients with hemolysis.
2. Classify the various types of hemolysis.
3. Identify the causes and types of hemolysis and explain the pathologic or genetic defect that leads to hemolysis.
4. Solve clinical scenarios related to hemolysis based on history, physical exam, genetics, maging, and lab findings.
5. Recognize the complications associated with hemolytic diseases.
6. Describe the treatment options for the various hemolytic diseases discussed in lecture
