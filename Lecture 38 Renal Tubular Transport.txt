Lecture 38 Renal Tubular Transport: NaCl and Water Reabsorption
1) Use the clearance equation concept to determine whether a solute is reabsorbed or secreted.
2) Compare the excretion of glucose, PAH and urea by means of their titration/clearance curves.
3) Understand the significance of the clearance ratio (Cx/Cinulin)
4) Explain how you would obtain the value of TF/P and what its significance is in understanding renal tubule function.
5) Explain the transport processes for the reabsorption of NaCl in the PCT.
6) How is water reabsorption coupled to NaCl reabsorption?
7) Explain the transport mechanisms in the PCT that are responsible for the secretion of organic anions and cations.
8) How is H+ secreted in the PCT and how is bicarbonate reabsorbed?
