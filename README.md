Medical Education
=================

Currently medical education sits behind an ivory wall. I believe it should be democratized. 

Specifically, the first two years of medical education is most conducive to being open. This is the basic medical sciences and is the focus of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 (there are 3). Thus anyone who is interested, passionate, and persistent could attain the level of knowledge required for the USMLE Step 1.

NOTE: While anyone can study the **basic** medical science of medical curricula, not everyone can practice as a physician. For that, each student has to earn the privilege to gain entry and develop skills and experience in the all-important clinical years.

Why Git?
---------

Medical schools are accredited by governing bodies, and the curriculum they provide must follow certain guidelines or standardization. This means that students from Harvard to insert-medical-school-name-here are learning the same material. After all, students from the 130+ medical schools in the nation must take the same USMLE Step 1 exam!

This is where Git comes in. Git can store and track the medical curriculum. Moreover, developers can design apps on top of the curriculum, further democratizing medical education.
