Lecture 32 Glomerular Filtration
1) Explain the composition of the filtration barrier and outline how it functions as a selective filter.
2) Define the sieving coefficient.
3) Describe the pressure profiles along the nephron-vascular unit and glomerular and peritubular capillary dynamics.
4) Make sure that you understand the concepts of Starling’s forces in describing the forces of ultrafiltration. What is the significance of the reflection coefficient in GFR. Why does GFR decrease in diabetes mellitus?
5) Compare the process of fluid exchange in a generalized systemic capillary and the specialized glomerular capillary. Understand the significance of the equilibrium pressure.
