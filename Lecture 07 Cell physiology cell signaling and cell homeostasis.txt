Lecture 7 Cell physiology cell signaling and cell homeostasis
1) Be familiar with the major signal transduction pathways by which binding of an extracellular regulatory molecule to its surface membrane receptor leads to altered cell function.
2) Recognize the major features of heterotrimeric G-protein dependent pathways including the production of active G-protein from the inactive form upon receptor binding.
3) Know the various target proteins of G-proteins. What second messengers are involved in their function? How do these second messengers act?
4) Be able to describe the function of the protein tyrosine kinase family of membrane receptors. How is insulin signaling involved in this?
5) Know the function and regulation of protein phosphatases.
