Lecture 43 Basic Concepts of Acid-Base Regulation
1) Identify the normal ranges of pH values, and the upper and lower limits compatible with life. Describe the role of buffers in maintaining pH, including the roles of the lungs and kidneys.
2) How does metabolism of food produce alkali and acid?
3) What is the difference between a volatile and nonvolatile acid?
4) Identify the major sites of reabsorption (and secretion) of bicarbonate along the nephron, emphasizing the importance of H+ secretory mechanisms in this process. Describe the cellular mechanisms responsible for net transepithelial movement of bicarbonate.
5) Describe net acid excretion by the kidneys, titratable acid, the importance of urinary buffers, and the production and excretion of ammonium. Distinguish between the reclamation of filtered bicarbonate and the formation of new bicarbonate.
