Lecture 48 Regional GI Motility
1) Explain the mechanism and significance of the fundic accommodation reflex. How would this reflex change with diabetes?
2) Explain the roles of the functional regions of the stomach. Correlate this with the electrical activity of the stomach.
3) Explain the effects of meal content, osmolarity, and volume on the rate of gastric emptying.
4) Explain the control of gastric emptying with special reference to the gastro-gastric and enterogastric reflexes.
5) Describe the patterns of contraction in the small intestine.
6) Contrast the patterns of intestinal motility seen during the absorptive phase (segmentation) with that of the post-abortive phase between meals.
7) State the functions of the ileocecal sphincter, including those factors that affect its behavior. Define the term “gastrointestinal reflex” and its mediators.
8) Explain the main motility patterns in the colon and outline their roles.
9) Describe the sequence of events occurring during reflexive defecation, differentiating those movements under voluntary control and those under intrinsic control.
