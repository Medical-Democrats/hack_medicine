Lecture 61 Metabolism
1) Identify the normal range of plasma glucose concentrations, and list the chemical forms and anatomical sites of storage pools for glucose and other metabolic substrates. 
2) Identify the hormones that promote the influx and efflux of glucose, fat, and protein into and out of energy storage pools and their impact on the uptake of glucose by tissues.  Establish specific roles for insulin, glucagon and catecholamines. 
3) Describe the changes in metabolic fuel utilization that occur in long- and short-term fasting and in acute and sustained exercise.  Understand how increases or decreases in hormone secretion produce these changes. 
4) Describe the role of appetite and metabolic rate in the maintenance of long-term energy balance and fat storage.  Identify the factors that regulate appetite and fuel oxidation.
