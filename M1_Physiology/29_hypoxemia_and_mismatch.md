Lecture 29 Hypoxemia and the V/Q ratio
1) Explain the major causes of hypoxemia
2) Define a “shunt”. Differentiate between an anatomic and a physiological shunt.
3) Use the concept of venous admixture to differentiate the two categories of a V/Q mismatch.
4) How is blood flow and ventilation distributed in the lung and how does this affect the arterial oxygen concentrations in the blood at various regions?
5) Predict how abnormal V/Q ratios will affect local alveolar O2 and CO2 pressure and exchange.
6) How does a V/Q mismatch affect the AaPO2 gradient?
7) How can V/Q mismatch be physiologically compensated?
