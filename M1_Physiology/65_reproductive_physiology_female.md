Lecture 65 Reproductive Physiology Female
1) Describe oogenesis and its relationship to changes in the ovarian follicle. Explain the roles of FSH, LH, estradiol, and  inhibin in oogenesis and follicular maturation. 
2) Describe ovulation and the formation and decline of the corpus luteum and the roles of hormones in each of these processes. 
3) Describe the hormonal regulation of estrogen and progesterone biosynthesis and secretion by the ovary.  Identify the cells responsible for their biosynthesis, the mechanism of their transport in the blood, and how they are degraded and removed from the body. 
4) List the major target organs and cell types for estrogen action and describe its effects on each. 
5) Describe the actions and cellular mechanisms of estrogen. 
6) List the principal physiological actions of progesterone, its major target organs and cell types, and describe its effects on each and the importance of “estrogen priming.” 
7) Describe the actions and cellular mechanisms of progesterone and other progestins. 
8) Graphically illustrate the timing of changes in blood levels of FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone, and inhibin, and correlate these with structural changes in the endometrium and the ovary seen during the menstrual cycle.  
9) Describe how the changes in ovarian steroids produce the proliferative and secretory phases of the uterine endometrium and menstruation and the changes in basal body temperature during the menstrual cycle. 
10) Understand aging- related changes in the hypothalamo-pituitary-goandal axis that lead to puberty, reproductive maturity, and reproductive senescence (menopause).
