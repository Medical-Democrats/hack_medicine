Lecture 10 Basic Concepts of Hemodynamics II

Main: understand the origin of arterial pressure and those factors that determine the value of the mean arterial pressure.

1. Understand the meaning of pressure in the circulation. Differentiate between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure. Calculate the MAP.

2. Know those factors that primarily determine blood pressure and those additional factors that affect the blood pressure. Explain the significance of MCFP or MCP.

3. Define compliance and explain how it affects blood pressure and the distribution of blood in the circulatory system. Explain the terms unstressed and stressed volumes and delayed compliance. What is the difference between compliance and elasticity?

4. Make use of diagrams to explain how the pulse pressure would be affected by changes in stroke volume and compliance.

5. Explain how gravity, flow velocity, and vessel compliance interact to affect the blood pressure

6. Explain the physiological and clinical significances of the Bernoulli principle in a normal flow situation and at a stenosis (how would the blood flow pattern be affected?)
