Lecture 47 Cellular Basis of Motility

1. Explain the functional significance of the term “functional electrical syncytium” as applied to the smooth musculature of the gut.

2. Differentiate between phasic and tonic contractions in the GIT and know where they occur.

3. Explain how electrical slow waves and action potentials are generated in the gastrointestinal musculature.

4. Understand the role of the slow waves in relation to smooth muscle contractility. Know the current theory regarding their generation. Know how a slow a wave may give rise to a muscle contraction. Describe the origin of the basic electrical rhythm in the GIT.

5. Describe the pressure changes that occur in the esophagus as a bolus of food moves from the pharynx to the stomach, including the pressures immediately oral and aboral to the bolus. Identify the normal resting esophageal pressure and explain why this pressure varies with the respiratory cycle.

6. Describe the motor behavior of the lower esophageal sphincter at the start of a swallow and after completion of a swallow.

7. Explain the motility defects that lead to heartburn with those leading to achalasia.

8. Explain the reservoir function of the stomach and define the major reflexes for relaxation of the musculature of the gastric reservoir.

9. Describe origin and form of electrical activity and the progression of periplastic waves across the body and antrum of the stomach. Include their role in mixing and propulsion of gastric contents and how the frequency is altered by the volume of gastric contents.
