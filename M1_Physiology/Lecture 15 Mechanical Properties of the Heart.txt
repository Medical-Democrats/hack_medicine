Lecture 15 Mechanical Properties of the Heart
1) State the steps in excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. Outline the sequence of events that occurs between the initiation of an action potential in a cardiac muscle cell and the resulting contraction and then relaxation of that cell. Provide specific details about the special role of Ca++ in the control of contraction and relaxation of cardiac muscle.
2) Outline the role of the regulators of intracellular calcium concentration.
3) Define the role of the extrinsic cardiac nerves in control of cardiac contractility. Pay attention to the signaling mechanisms and the roles of cAMP and PKA.
4) How do hormones control the long-term contractility of the heart?
5) How does digitalis function as  a positive ionotropic agent?
