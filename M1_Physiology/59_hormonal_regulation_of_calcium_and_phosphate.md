Lecture 59 Hormonal Regulation of Calcium and Phosphate

1. Identify the normal range of dietary calcium intake, calcium distribution in the body, and routes of calcium excretion.

2. Identify the normal range of dietary phosphate intake, phosphate distribution in the body, and routes of phosphate excretion.

3. Know the cells of origin for parathyroid hormone, its biosynthesis and degradation.

4. List the target organs and cell types for parathyroid hormone and describe its effects on each.

5. Describe the functions of the osteoblasts and the osteoclasts in bone remodeling and the factors that regulate their activities.

6. Describe the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion and the role of the calcium-sensing receptor.

7. Understand the causes and consequences of a) over-secretion, and b) under-secretion of parathyroid hormone, as well as its therapeutic use.

8. Describe the normal function of parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) and its role as a marker for some cancers.

9. Identify the sources of vitamin D and diagram the biosynthetic pathway and the organs involved in modifying it to the biologically active 1,25(OH2)D3  (1-25 dihydroxy cholecalciferol).

10. Identify the target organs and cellular mechanisms of action for vitamin D.

11. Describe the negative feedback relationship between parathyroid hormone and the biologically active form of vitamin D [1,25(OH2)D3]. 

12. Describe the consequences of vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D excess.

13. Name the stimuli that can promote secretion of calcitonin, its actions, and identify which (if any) are physiologically important.
