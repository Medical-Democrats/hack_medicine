Lecture 17 Cardiac Pump Performance Part II

1. Explain how ventricular compliance may be a factor in controlling CO.

2. Understand and explain the reciprocal relationship between venous and arterial pressure.

3. Understand the role of venous return in defining vascular and cardiac function curves.

4. Use the cardiac function curve to explain how Starling’s Law of the heart can match the output of the right and left ventricles.

5. Draw and define vascular function curve.

6. Superimpose cardiac function and vascular function curves and explain why the intersection point represents the steady-state CO and CVP under the condition represented in the graph.

7. Use the intersection point of the combined curves to predict how interventions such as hemorrhage, heart failure, and autonomic stimulation will affect CO and central venous pressure.

8. Use the curves to understand the hemodynamic effects of exercise and the complications and compensations with moderate heart failure.
