Lecture 6 Muscle Physiology

1. Describe the classification of muscle fiber types and their composition.

2. Describe the molecular make-up of the thick filament. Discuss the shape of the myosin molecule, its subunits, and the proposed physiological importance of the subunits.

3. Describe the molecule make-up of the thin filament. List the proteins that are found in the thin filament, their subunits, and physiological significance.

4. Describe the cross-bridge cycle and the accompanying biochemical steps in ATP hydrolysis.

5. Describe the sarcomere length-tension relationship. With reference to the lengths of the thick and thin filaments, discuss how changing filament overlap can explain many of the features of the curve.

6. Understand the process of the excitation-contraction coupling and the regulation of the intracellular calcium in the striated muscle. Compare the process in skeletal and smooth muscle.

7. How is ATP generated in muscle cells?

8. Describe and compare the length-tension relationships of skeletal and smooth muscle. What is the significance?

9. Be able to draw a typical-force-velocity relationship for a muscle. What factors are important in determining shortening velocity?
