Lecture 24 Static Mechanics and Ventilation Part 1

1. Describe the generation of a pressure gradient between the atmosphere and alveoli. In your description state the relevance of Boyle’s Law and include the function of the main respiratory muscles involved both during a normal quiet tidal breath and during forced expiration.

2. Define the major transmural pressure gradients in the respiratory system.

3. Describe the changes in alveolar pressure, intraplueral pressure, atmospheric pressure, and transpulmonary pressure during a single respiratory cycle during normal quiet breathing (eupnea) and relate swings in intrapleural pressure to the two forces that the inspiratory muscles must overcome to inflate the lungs.

4. Define the meaning of the term hysteresis as seen in the pressure-volume curve of the human lung.

5. Describe how the static lung compliance is measured with reference to the pressure-volume curve of the lung obtained during deflation of the lungs from TLC to FRC. Describe how the pressure –volume curve of a stiff lung and the pressure-volume curve of a highly distensible lung encountered in disease states would change.

6. Use a diagram to define the elastic recoil properties of each respiratory compartment.
