Lecture 9 Basic Concepts of Hemodynamics I: Flow and Resistance

Main: physical laws that govern the circulation of blood.

1. In understanding the organization of the circulatory system, explain how the performances of the right and left heart rate are interconnected because of their anatomic arrangement in series.

2. Use Ohm’s law to understand the relationship between pressure, flow, and resistance in the vascular system and be able to calculate for one variable if the other two are known.

3. Understand the basic hemodynamic principles of blood flow.
	+ What is the difference between cardiac output and index? Know the normal values
	+ Distinguish between “velocity” and “volume” flow in the system. Use the laws of continuity of flow to explain the factors that influence the velocity of flow. Why and where is flow velocity highest?
	+ Use Reynolds number to explain why and where you would most likely expect to find turbulence. Use this information to explain the common sites of atherosclerosis.
	+ Explain the meaning of the term “shear stress”. Where is the shear stress the highest in an artery?
	+ Define the terms “axial streaming” and plasma skimming.

4. Explain how Poiseuilles’ Law influences resistance to flow. Use it to calculate changes in resistance in a blood vessel.

5. Understand the meaning of blood viscosity and those factors that mostly affects the value of viscosity.

6. Understand the effects of adding resistance in series vs in parallel on total resistance and flow. Apply concept to the redistribution of flow from the aorta to the sissues during exercise. What is a clinical significance of having branches in parallel when a portion of the heart is denied oxygen?

7. How would you calculate TPR, SVR, and TPR?
