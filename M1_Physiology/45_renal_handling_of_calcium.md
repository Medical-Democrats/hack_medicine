Lecture 45 Renal Handling of Ca++, Pi and Mg++

1. What is the physiological importance of calcium and Pi?

2. Identify the tubular sites of Ca++, Pi, and Mg++ reabsorption in the kidney.

3. Identify the major storage pools and major routes of Ca++ loss from the body.

4. List the hormones that are responsible for regulating Ca++ and Pi levels.

5. Describe the cellular mechanisms responsible for Ca++, Pi, and Mg++ reabsorption along the nephron. Elaborate on the roles played by calbindin and paracellin?

6. Explain the effects and significance of loop and thiazide diuretics on calcium excretion.
