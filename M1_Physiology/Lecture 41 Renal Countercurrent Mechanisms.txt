Lecture 41 Renal Countercurrent Mechanisms
1) Understand the general mechanisms for making diluted and concentrated urine.
2) Understand the meaning of solute exchangers and solute countercurrent mechanisms.
3) Understand the mechanism of single level osmotic gradient. Explain how this is converted into a countercurrent multiplier mechanism.
4) Describe the urea recycling process and understand its importance in making concentrated urine.
5) Describe the passive countercurrent exchange mechanism in the vasa recta. What is the significance?
6) Explain by example how the diluting and concentrating ability of the kidneys is quantified.
