Lecture 49 Gastrointestinal Secretions Part 1
1) Contrast the plasma and saliva concentrations of Na+, Cl-, and bicarbonate at low and high secretion rates.
2) Explain the mechanism whereby saliva is secreted.
3) Describe how the secretion of saliva is controlled.
4) Describe the mechanism of acid secretion by the parietal cells. Include a description of the origin of an “alkaline tide” in the hepatic portal venous system following ingestion of a meal.
5) Explain the neural, paracrine and endocrine control of gastric acid secretion. Differentiate especially between the direct and indirect stimulation of HCl.
6) Outline the regulation of gastric acid secretion as observed in the phases of gastric acid secretion. What is the role of the “duodenal brake” in this control?
7) Explain how the gastric mucosa is protected by its barrier and how the barrier is affected by aspirin and Helicobacter pylori.
