Lecture 25 Static Mechanics of Ventilation Part 2

1. Use the relaxation curve (P-V curve) to define the factors that determine total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume. Compare the P-V curve in someone standing with one lying down and compare the PV curve of the healthy individual to those with emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis.

2. Explain how surfactant lowers surface tension in the lungs and at different lung volumes.

3. Understand how surfactant prevents atelectasis and stabilizes the alveoli. How does surfactant assist the lung during inspiration? What would you expect to occur during respiratory stress syndrome?

4. Explain the regional differences in ventilation in the upright lung.
