Lecture 63 Endocrine Integrity of Energy and Electrolyte Balance
1) Explain how thyroid, gonadal, and adrenal hormones modulate growth. 
2) Understand the nature and actions of local growth factors: epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors.  
3) Identify the normal range of dietary sodium intake, sodium distribution in the body, and routes of sodium excretion.  Explain the roles of antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone, angiotensin, and atrial natriuretic hormone in the regulation of sodium balance. 
4) Identify the normal range of dietary potassium intake, potassium distribution in the body, and routes of potassium excretion.  Explain how acute changes in aldosterone, insulin, and acid/base concentrations affect the plasma potassium concentration and the movement of potassium into and out of the intracellular compartment.  Explain the chronic regulation of body potassium balance and plasma potassium levels by aldosterone through its actions on renal excretion, intestinal excretion, and dietary appetite/absorption.
