Lecture 1 Osmosis and Body Fluids
1) Know the major body fluid compartments and their relative volumes for an average young adult man and woman. Use the concept of mass balance and show how to measure the volume of each compartment.
2) Describe the ionic composition of extracellular and intracellular fluids.
3) Explain the osmotic movement of water. Know how to calculate the estimate plasma osmolality.
4) Define the osmotic pressure. Understand the difference between osmolarity and tonicity. What is an isotonic solution of NaCl? Describe the effects of permeating solutes on cell volume.
5) Explain the significance of sodium in the distribution of water between fluid compartments.
6) Distinguish between hydraulic conductivity and reflection of coefficient. Define the reflection coefficient. How do we us it? How does it affect the osmotic flow of water?
7) Explain the Donnan effect of impermeant proteins and the role of sodium-potassium pump in counteracting the Donnan effect.
