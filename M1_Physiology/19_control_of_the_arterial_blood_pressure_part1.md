Lecture 19 Control of the Arterial Blood Pressure Part I

1. Contrast the relative contribution of short- and long-term mechanisms in blood pressure and blood volume regulation.

2. List the components involved in the baroreceptors reflex. Explain the sequence of events in the baroreflex that occur after an acute increase and decrease (shock) in arterial blood pressure.

3. Use the baroreceptor reflex to explain the orthostatic hypotension reflex.

4. Explain the sequence of events mediated by cardiopulmonary (volume) receptors that occur after an acute volume overload.

5. Explain the stimuli and responses by other short-term reflexes.

6. Understand and explain the reflexes responsible for the intermediate control of the blood pressure. Explain the term stress relaxation in blood vessels and the bladder.
