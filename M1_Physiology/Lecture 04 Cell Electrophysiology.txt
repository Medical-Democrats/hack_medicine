Lecture 4 Cell Electrophysiology: Membrane Potentials
1) Understand the relationships between electrodiffusion, diffusion potentials, and membrane conductance. Which factors determine the ionic conductance of a membrane?
2) Write the Nerst equation, and indicate how this equation accounts for both the chemical and electrical driving forces that act on an ion. Define the electrochemical equilibrium and equilibrium potential.
3) Be able to use the Nernst equation to solve problems and explain the effects of altering the intracellular or extracellular Na+, K+, Cl-, or Ca++ concentration on the equilibrium potential for that ion. For example, contrast the difference in E(K+) caused by a 5 mEq/l increase in extracellular K+ with the change in E(Na+) caused by a 5 mEq/l increase in extracellular Na+.
4) Understand the driving force acting on the movement of an ion. Be able to describe the forces acting on the each ionic species and thus the direction that each ion will tend to move across the membrane.
5) Explain how the resting membrane potential is generated and calculate Vm by using either a) the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation or b) the chord conductance equation. Given an increase or decrease in the permeability of K, Na, or Cl, predict how the membrane potential would change.
6) Describe the concentration run-down through leakage channels and explain the importance of the Na-K-ATPase in maintaining ionic gradients.
7) Use a simple IV plot to explain the meaning of the term outward rectification.
