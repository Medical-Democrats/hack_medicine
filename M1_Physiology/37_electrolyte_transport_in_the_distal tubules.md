Lecture 37 Electrolyte Transport in the Distal Tubules

1. Describe the cellular mechanisms for the transport of Na+, Cl-, K+ and water by the major distal tubular segments.

2. Explain the mechanism of K+ and H+ secretion in the distal tubules.

3. Describe how cations are passively absorbed in the TAL.

4. Describe the nephron sites and molecular mechanisms of action of the major classes of diuretics. Explain what is meant by the braking phenomenon.

5. Explain why diuretics may cause alkalosis or hypokalemia. Explain the mechanism of action of a potassium-sparing diuretic. Explain why loop diuretics may be used to treat hypercalcemia and thiazide diuretics to treat renal stones.
