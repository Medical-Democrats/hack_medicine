Lecture 44 Basic Concepts of Acid-Base Regulation 2

1. How does the bicarbonate system operate as a buffer?

2. How do the kidneys and lungs contribute to systematic acid-base balance?

3. Why are urinary buffers necessary for the excretion of acid?

4. How are the mechanisms for H+ secretion and excretion regulated?

5. What are the major mechanisms by which the body defends itself against changes in acid-base balance?

6. How are the simple acid-base disturbances differentiated by blood gas measurements? What are the compensatory mechanisms?

7. What are the urine anion gap and the anion gap and how is it used?
