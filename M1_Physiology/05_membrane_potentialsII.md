Lecture 5 Membrane Potentials II: The Action Potential

1. Describe the passive electrical properties of neuronal membrane.

2. Define membrane capacitance and identify how membrane capacitance affects the spread of current in myelinated and demyelinated neurons.

3. Appreciate the relationship between single channel currents and the macroscopic ionic currents that move across the membrane during an action potential.

4. Be able to describe the properties of an action potential (use terminology associated with electrical responses of excitable cells) and explain the ionic mechanisms of the action potential.

5. Explain the basis for the refractory period.

6. Contrast the generation and conduction of graded potentials with that of action potentials.

7. Describe the basis for the calculation of the space constant and time constant of neuron process and explain how these affect the conduction of the passive response.

8. Compare conduction velocities in a compound nerve, identifying how the diameter and myelination lead to differences in conduction velocity.
