Lecture 40 Control of Body Fluid Osmolality

1. Understand the major points of water balance. Differentiate insensitive and obligatory water loss.

2. Explain why changes in water balance result in alterations in the concentration of Na+ in the ECF.

3. Describe where the main osmoreceptors are located and explain how they respond to changes in ECF osmolality.

4. Explain how the secretion of ADH is controlled by the interaction of body fluid osmolality, blood volume, and pressure.

5. Explain the role of thirst in the control of osmolality and how is it controlled?
