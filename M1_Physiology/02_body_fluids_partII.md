Lecture 2 Body Fluids Part II

1. You should be able to calculate the plasma osmolality. Explain what the osmolal gap means.
2. Outline the mechanisms involved in water balance in the body.
3. Make use of diagrams to hsow how to calculate final osmolality and volume of ICF and ECF compartments when faced with different types of osmotic and/or volume challenge.
4. Explain the volume and osmolality changes that occur in six clinical volume states.
5. What do you understand by the terms crystalloid and colloid IV fluids. List some examples of each and give some examples of circumstances where you would prescribe either a crystalloid or colloid.
6. Explain the role of aquaporins and junctional (tight) complexes in the flux of water.
