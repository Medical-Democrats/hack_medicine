Lecture 58 Thyroid Gland

1. Identify the steps in the biosynthesis, storage, and secretion of tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) and their regulation.

2. Describe the absorption, uptake, distribution, and excretion of iodide.
3. Explain the importance of thyroid hormone binding in blood on free and total thyroid hormone levels.

4. Understand the significance of the conversion of T4 to T3 and reverse T3 (rT3) in extra-thyroidal tissues.

5. Describe the physiologic effects and mechanisms of action of thyroid hormones.

6. Understand the causes and consequences of a) over-secretion and b) under-secretion of thyroid hormones.  Explain what conditions can cause an enlargement of the thyroid gland.
