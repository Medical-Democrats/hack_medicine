Lecture 14 Electrical Activity in the Heart:_The ECG Part II
1) Define the mean electrical vector (axis) of the heart. Understand how this may be determined and which factors would change the axis. List some of the major causes of axis deviation.
2) List the major ECG changes during evolution of myocardial ischemia.
3) Understand what an injury current is and explain how this would affect an ECG recording.
4) Use this information to distinguish between an transmural and subendocardial ischemia.
5) How would necrosis affect the appearance of the ECG?
6) Understand how you would diagnose ventricular hypertrophy
