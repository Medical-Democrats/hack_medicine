Lecture 30 The Controller of the Respiratory System
1) Identify the regions in the central nervous system that play important roles in the generation and control of cyclic breathing.
2) What is the role of the motor cortex in control of breathing? Is it essential to the breathing rhythm?
3) What is the role and mechanisms of chemical control of respirations? What are the major stimuli of the different receptors? Differentiate between the roles of the peripheral and the central chemoreceptors.
4) Explain how mechanical or chemical irritation of the airways result in coughing, bronchoconstriction and shallow breathing.
5) Explain the origin of the typical respiratory symptoms caused by the congestive heart failure.
6) How is the depth of breathing controlled by stretch-sensitive, mechanical receptors?
