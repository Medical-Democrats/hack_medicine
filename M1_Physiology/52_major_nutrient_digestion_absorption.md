Lecture 52 Insight into Digestion and Absorption of Major Nutrients

1. Explain the reasons and mechanism of intestinal epithelial cell turnover.

2. List the chemical classes of the carbohydrates entering the duodenum from the stomach, and identify mechanisms mediating further digestion and absorption across the intestinal epithelia. Include pancreatic secretions and brush-border enzymes. Use this information to explain lactose intolerance and celiac disease.

3. Identify mechanisms mediating protein digestion and absorption across the intestinal epithelia. Include pancreatic secretions and brush border enzymes.

4. Explain and contrast the absorption of amino acids with that of di- and tri-peptides, including the ion used as the energy source.

5. Identify mechanisms mediating digestion and absorption of lipids in the intestine. Explain the roles of pancreatic lipase, colipase, and the roles of micelles in the process.

6. Describe how the lipid digestion products are transported across the enterocyte.

7. Outline how VitB12 is reabsorbed and transported and the link between B12 and pernicious anemia.
