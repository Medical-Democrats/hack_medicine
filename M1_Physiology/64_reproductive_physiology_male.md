Lecture 64 Reproductive Physiology Male

1. Describe the physiological functions of the major components of the male reproductive tract.

2. Describe spermatogenesis and the role of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and the basement membrane in this process.

3. Describe the endocrine regulation of testicular function: the role of the GnRH pulse generator, FSH, LH, testosterone, and inhibin.

4. Describe the, biosynthesis, mechanism of transport within the blood, metabolism and elimination of testosterone and related androgens.

5. List the major target organs and cell types for testosterone and other androgens.

6. Describe the actions and cellular mechanisms of testosterone and related androgens.

7. Describe the neural, vascular, and endocrine components of the erection and ejaculation response.

8. Identify the causes and consequences of over-secretion and under secretion of testosterone for a) prepubertal and b) postpubescent males.

9. Understand aging- related changes in the hypothalamo-pituitary-goandal axis that lead to puberty, reproductive maturity, and reproductive senescence (andropause).
