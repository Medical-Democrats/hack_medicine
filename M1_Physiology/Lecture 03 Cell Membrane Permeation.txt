Lecture 3 Cell Membrane Permeation: Cellular Mechanisms
1) Explain the significance of driving forces responsible for water flux across cell membranes.
2) Explain the significance of the diffusion equation. Explain the meaning of partition and permeability coefficients. How does this differ from facilitated diffusion?
3) Know the major physiological roles of ion channels and their characteristics.
4) Explain the importance and characteristics of carrier-mediated transport systems.
5) Use specific examples to explain the differences between primary and secondary active transport.
6) Describe how energy from ATP hydrolysis is used to transport ions such as Na+, K+, Ca++, and H+ against their electrochemical gradient.
Understand the role of ATP-binding cassette in transporters in, for example, multi-drug resistance and its significance for cancer therapy
