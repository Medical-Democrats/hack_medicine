Lecture 54 Endocrine Physiology_General Principles

1. Explain the principle of negative feedback control of hormone secretion. 

2. Explain the principles of positive feedback and feed forward control of hormone secretion. 

3. Explain the bases of hormone measurements and assessment of biological activity. 

4. Contrast the terms endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine based on the site of hormone release and the pathway to the target tissue.  Provide an example of each, and describe major differences in mechanisms of action of peptides and steroids working through membrane receptors and steroids, vitamin D, and thyroid hormones working through nuclear receptors. 

5. Contrast the location and signaling pathways of membrane bound and intracellular hormone receptors.  For membrane bound hormone receptors, describe the process of activation, inactivation, up-regulation, down-regulation, sensitization, and desensitization. 

6. Define and describe the interactions between hormones, target cells, and receptors. 

7. Compare and contrast hormone actions that are exerted through changes in gene expression with those exerted through changes in protein activity, such as through phosphorylation. 

8. Contrast the signal transduction pathways involved in G-protein coupled receptors, receptor enzymes (i.e., tyrosine kinase), and ligand-gated ion channels.

9. Understand the effects of plasma hormone binding proteins on access of thyroid hormones and steroid hormones to their sites of action and degradation and on the regulation of hormone secretion. 

10. Explain the effects of secretion, excretion, degradation, and volume of distribution on the concentration of a hormone in blood plasma.
11) Explain the importance of patterns of hormone secretion, such as pulsatile, diurnal, and menstrual
