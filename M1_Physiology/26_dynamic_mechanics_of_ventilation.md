Lecture 26 Dynamic Mechanics of Ventilation
1) Describe the flow, resistance, velocity and their changes in their magnitude in airway during airflow.
2) Identify and explain the factors that determine bronchiolar tone.
3) Explain how forced expirations cause flow limitations at low lung volumes (below FRC) in accordance with a Starling resistor model. Use the concept of dynamic compression of airway and flow-limitation to explain why each point in the effort-independent region of the curve represents a maximal flow rate that is uniquely dependent on lung volume.
4) Describe how and why the shape of the flow-volume curve is shifted in chronic obstructive lung disease.
5) Understand the physiologic basis of the measurements obtained during Pulmonary Function Testing and use these to interpret PFTs for obstructive and restrictive diseases.
