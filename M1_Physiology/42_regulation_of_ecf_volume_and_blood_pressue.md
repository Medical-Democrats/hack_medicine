Lecture 42 Regulation of ECF Volume and Blood Pressue

1. Explain why changes in Na+ blacne alter the volume of the ECF.

2. Explain what the effective circulating volume is and how it is influenced by changes in Na+ balance.

3. Explain the mechanisms whereby the ECV is monitored.

4. List the major signals acting on the kidneys to alter the excretion of Na+

5. Diagram the formation of angiotensin II (AT II)

6. Identify the three major factors that promote renin release.

7. Describe the influence of AT II on renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the renal tubules.

8. Describe the major functions of aldosterone.

9. Know the hormones that promote and diminish Na+ excretion.
