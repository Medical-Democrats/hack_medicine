Lecture 53 Fluid and Electrolyte Transport in the GI Tract

1. Explain the molecular structure of the epithelial barrier with reference to the role of claudins.

2. Draw a diagram to illustrate water balance in the GI tract. Explain the mechanism whereby water is transported in the intestine. Differentiate between isotonic and hypertonic absorbers.

3. Use diagrams to explain the mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and secretion in the small intestine. Pay special attention to the transport of Na+, Cl-, and bicarbonate. Explain how K+ is secreted by the colon.

4. Use cystic fibrosis as an example to explain the significance of the knowledge of transport proteins in the pathogenesis of disease.

5. Classify, with examples, the major types of diarrhea. Use cholera to explain the pathophysiology of secretory diarrhea. Explain
