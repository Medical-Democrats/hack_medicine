Lecture 28 Major Points of Pulmonary Blood Supply

1. Explain the need for a bronchial and a pulmonary circulation.

2. Describe and explain the effects of lung volume on pulmonary vascular resistance.

3. Explain the effects of an increase in intravascular pressure on pulmonary vascular resistance.

4. List the major neural and humoral factors that influence pulmonary vascular resistance.

5. Describe hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and explain the significance of this mechanism.

6. Describe the interrelationships of alveolar pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary venous pressure on pulmonary blood flow. How does all this influence the regional distribution of pulmonary blood flow?

7. Describe how gravity affects pulmonary blood flow. How would a change in body position affect this flow as well as the regional distribution of blood flow.
