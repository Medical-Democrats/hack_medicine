Lecture 27 Pulmonary Gas Exchange

1. Explain the factors involved in Fick’s law of gas diffusion.

2. Use Fick’s equation to identify those factors that determine the diffusing capacity of the lung to O2.

3. What do you understand by the diffusing capacity of the lung? What does it mean?

4. Explain the difference between diffusion and perfusion-limited gas exchange, with examples.

5. Describe the diffusion of O2 and CO2 across the alveolar-capillary barrier.

6. Explain why normal subjects at very high altitude or patients with lung disease may have a diffusion limitation during exercise.

7. Define the lung diffusing capacity and discuss its measurement.

8. What is the significance of the AO2-aO2 gradient and what is the normal range? Show how to calculate PAO2 using the simplified alveolar-air equation. List those factors that would increase the A-aDO2 gradient.
