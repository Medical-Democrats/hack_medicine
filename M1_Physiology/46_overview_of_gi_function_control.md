Lecture 46 An Overview of the Control of GI Function

1. Explain the hierarchy of control of the GI functions

2. Identify the elements comprising the enteric (intrinsic) nervous system and outline their role in neural control of GI function. Explain their integration with the autonomic nervous system.

3. Classify the major enteric nervous system neurotransmitters as excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters.

4. Provide an outline of a generalized intrinsic reflex. By means of an example, explain the role of serotonin in this process. Identify the major stimuli in this process.

5. Contrast the sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of the enteric nervous system.

6. Classify the major established GI hormones, candidate hormones, paracrine peptides and neurocrine peptides according to their sties of secretion and their most important physiological functions.

7. Explain briefly the role of the GI immune system in the regulation of GI activities. Outline the role of histamine in the acute allergic response of the intestine.
