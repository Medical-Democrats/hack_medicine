Lecture 18 Control of the Vasculature

1. Explain the concept of vascular tone and understand the effects that changing tone will influence blood flow to specific organs such as the kidney, brain, active muscle.

2. Explain the significance of basal tone in the control of blood flow. 

3. Outline and explain the role of the autonomic nervous system in control of the heart and vasculature. How does the parasympathetic system control the vasculature?

4. Define autoregulation of blood flow.

5. Explain the mechanisms that can account for autoregulation.

6. Discuss the endothelial control of blood flow and indicate which paracrine substances contribute to regulation of the microcirculation. Pay special attention to the role of NO. explain the role of nitroglycerine in the treatment of angina.
