Lecture 16 Cardiac Pump Mechanics

1. Understand the hemodynamic events occurring during different phases of the cardiac cycle and be able to explain these on the pressure-volume diagram.

2. Understand how the end-diastolic pressure volume relationship (EDPVR) and the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship characterize ventricular diastolic and systolic properties, respectively.

3. Understand the physiological basis of the cardiac function curve (aka Starling curves). Understand how cardiac function curves change with changed contractility, preload, afterload and compliance

4. Use the P-V loop to demonstrate and understand how changes in left ventricular end-diastolic volume, aortic pressure, and contractility affect stroke volume.

5. Explain how the reciprocal relationship between heart rate and stroke volume helps maintain cardiac output at high heart rates and at low heart rates.

6. Use the P-V loop concept to differentiate between systolic and diastolic heart failure.
