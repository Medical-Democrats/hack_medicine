Lecture 50 Gastrointestinal Secretion Part 2

1. Outline the secretion of the exocrine pancreas. What roles are played by the acini and by the ducts?

2. Contrast the plasma and pancreatic concentrations of Na+, Cl-, and bicarbonate at low secretion rates and at high secretion rates.

3. Explain the mechanism whereby the pancreatic duct produces a bicarbonate rish secretion. How is the affected by the rate of secretion?

4. Outline the main mechanisms whereby the pancreas is protected against autodigestion.

5. List the stimuli that release a) secretin and b) CCK and cellular mechanisms by which these agents control pancreatic secretion. Include any synergistic effects between CCK and secretin.

6. Describes the role of CFTR in pancreatic ductular secretion, and predict the consequences of cystic fibrosis on the GI system.
