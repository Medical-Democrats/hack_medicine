Lecture 11 Basic Concepts of Hemodynamics III

1. Understand the significance of a pressure drop in the circulation. Explain what happens to the upstream and downstream pressures with a changing arteriolar resistance.

2. Draw and explain the shape of the pressure pulse wave.

3. Explain the major determinants of pulse velocity and amplitude.

4. Make use of diagrams to explain how the pulse pressure would be affected by changes in stroke volume and compliance.

5. How is the aorta responsible for converting an intermittent pump into a continuous blood flow?

6. Explain the meaning of the Law of LaPlace in terms of the transmural pressure and wall tension. How does the law of LaPlace vary between thin-walled, thick-walled, and spherical hollow structures?
