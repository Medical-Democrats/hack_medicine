Lecture 62 Pancreas

1. Identify the major hormones secreted from the endocrine pancreas, their cells of origin, and their chemical nature.

2. List the target organs or cell types for glucagon and describe its principal actions on each.

3. List the major target organs or cell types for insulin, the major effects of insulin on each, and the consequent changes in concentration of blood constituents.

4. Identify the time course for the onset and duration for the biological actions of insulin.

5. Understand the relationship between blood glucose concentrations and insulin secretion.

6. Describe the roles of neural input and gastrointestinal hormones on insulin secretion.  List the factors that modulate the secretory response.

7. Describe the control of glucagon secretion.

8. Identify disease states caused by and describe the principle symptoms of each:
	+ over-secretion of insulin
	+ under-secretion of insulin
	+ decreased sensitivity to insulin
