Lecture 12 Electrical Activity in the Heart – Action Potentials
1) Ensuring that you understand fundamental concepts and can explain the cause of a change in Vm (by using GHK), conductance, threshold and a rectifier channel.
2) Understand the difference between “fast-“ and “slow-response” cells in the heart.
3) Draw an action potential characteristic of ventricular cells, label its phases and describe the role of the membrane’s ion currents and conductances for each phase.
4) Understand the ionic basis for automaticity in the SAN. What is a latent pacemaker?
5) Distinguish between a sinus rhythm and a junctional rhythm?
6) Describe the effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic activation on automaticity. Understand the specific ionic mechanisms involved these automatic effects.
7) Define and explain the differences between absolute (effective) refractory period, the relative refractory period and supranormal period in cardiac cells. Graph the relationship between that channel’s availability and membrane potential. State the significance of the periods to the normal pulsatile function of the heart.
8) Draw a diagram to plot the conduction of the cardiac impulse. What is AV delay and what is its significance?
