Lecture 13 Electrical Activity in the Heart_The EKG Part 1

1. Define the term dipole. Describe characteristics that define a vector. Describe how dipoles generated by the heart produce the waveforms of the ECG.

2. Understand the principles of vectors and how a vector may influence the recording of an ECG.

3. Understand the difference between bipolar and unipolar leads.

4. Describe the electrode conventions used by clinicians to standardize ECG measurements. Know the electrode placements and polarities for at least the 6 frontal leads.

5. Explain how Einthoven’s triangle is generated. Explain how the triangle may be used to determine the direction and amplitude of a vector recording.

6. Name the parts of a typical bipolar (Lead II) ECG tracing and explain the relationship between each of the waves, intervals, and segments in relation to the electrical state of the heart.

7. Explain why the ECG tracing looks different in each of the 12 leads.

8. Explain the phases of the ECG as recorded by the limb leads.
