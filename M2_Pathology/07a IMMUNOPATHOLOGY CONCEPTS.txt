IMMUNOPATHOLOGY CONCEPTS 


Much of the Immunopathology that is contained in the M2 General Pathology Curriculum has been previously presented to you, in the M1 year and/or in Infection & Immunity class. Therefore, this session will be an interactive exercise…

OBJECTIVES: Upon completion of this section, the student will be able to:



1. Compare and contrast the four (4) types of immunologically mediated (hypersensitivity) disorders, in terms of: terminology, definition, subtypes, stimulating antigens, pathogenesis, mediators involved, cells involved, tissues involved, examples, morphologic features, clinical features.



2. Compare and contrast the etiology, pathogenesis, morphology, time course of the following types of solid organ transplant rejection: hyperacute rejection, acute rejection (cellular, humoral), chronic rejection.


3. Discuss graft-versus-host (GVH) disease, in terms of etiopathogenesis, cells and antigens involved, morphology, basic clinical features, prognosis.


4. Discuss different mechanisms by which immune tolerance may be lost in the general pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.


5. Discuss the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases in terms of genetic factors and effects of microbial agents.


6. Distinguish between systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases, and list the most frequent examples of each.
