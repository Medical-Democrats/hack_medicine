CLINICAL FEATURES OF NEOPLASMS

OBJECTIVES:

1. List the six major types of effects of malignant tumors on the host, and give at least one example of each.

2. Discuss the following paraneoplastic syndromes:
	* acanthosis nigricans
	* anemia
	* cerebellar degeneration
	* Cushing syndrome
	* dermatomyositis
	* hypercalcemia
	* hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy
	* migratory venous thrombosis
	* myasthenia (Eaton-Lambert syndrome)
	* non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis
	* polycythemia

	in terms of:
	* pathogenesis
	* morphologic findings
	* associated neoplasms

3. Describe the various diagnostic procedures and/or laboratory tests used to diagnose, and monitor the progression of, neoplasms.

4. Describe cancer cachexia in terms of:
	* pathogenesis
	* clinical effects

5. Compare and contrast grading and staging of malignant tumors, and state the important elements utilized in both.

6. Discuss the most effective ways to utilize tumor markers (biochemical, immunohistochemical) in the diagnosis of malignant neoplasms, as well as in the management of patients with cancer, and correlate the most frequently utilized tumor markers with their associated neoplasms.
