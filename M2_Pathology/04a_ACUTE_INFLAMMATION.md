ACUTE INFLAMMATION

OBJECTIVES:

1. List the five major causes of inflammation.

2. Describe the five cardinal signs of inflammation in terms of pathogenesis and underlying morphologic changes.

3. Describe the classic vascular changes and cellular events of the inflammatory reaction. Elaborate on: 
	* vascular changes, including response of lymphatic vessels
	* cellular changes and cellular functions including the histologic appearance of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and platelets and their major roles in inflammation
	* chemical mediators

4. Describe the steps involved in leukocyte extravasation in inflammation, as well as in the isolation and destruction of an infectious agent by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils).  Describe the most important related extracellular and intracellular factors.

5. Describe the process of phagocytosis. Give examples of diseases associated with defects in leukocyte function.

6. Compare and contrast the common chemical mediators of inflammation, in terms of origin (cells vs. plasma), mechanisms of formation, release, and activation, and chief in vivo functions.

7. Explain the factors operative in the termination of the inflammatory response, and compare and contrast resolution and organization with respect to the termination of an inflammatory response.
