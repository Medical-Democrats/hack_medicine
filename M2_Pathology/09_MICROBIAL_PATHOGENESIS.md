Microbial Pathogenesis

TOPIC: Mechanisms of Cell Injury and Death in Man--The Roles Played by Microbes and/or their parts.

GOAL:  Too introduce and discuss host cell injury & death as impacted by selected Microbes and Microbial Cell Components

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

1. To learn how four selected ubiquitous pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS)  impact host cell injury and death. The PAMPS will include: 
	* Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) & Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of Gram negatives
	* Lipoteichoic Acid (LTA) from Gram positives
	* Peptidoglycan from Gram positives and negatives (PGN)
	* (1-3)-?-D-Glucan from Fungi (BDG)

2. To introduce the concept of DAMPs damage associated molecular patterns. 

To illustrate examples of resulting pathology caused by selected PAMPS.

3. To differentiate host cell surface/cytoplasmic (Toll-like receptors; TLR) vs. cytoplasmic only receptors (NOD-like receptors; NLR) for microbial PAMPS and discuss selected ligands for the TLR and NLRs.

4. To elucidate an important common gene region shared by many microbial receptors (LRR; Leucine Rich Repeats).

5. To learn the basis of bacterial Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS; Shock) produced by both Gram positive/negative bacteria & trauma and define the continuum from infection/trauma to septic shock and death.

6. To illustrate selected major consequences (e.g. coagulation) resulting from mediators induced by Gram-negative bacteria in shock (SIRS).

7. To elaborated on the multi-functions of Activated Protein C and the impact of its dysregulation on sepsis.
                                                                                                                         
8. Define and discuss “NETS” and relation to sepsis and histones.

9. To discuss “What new on the horizon” in Sepsis/Septic Shock Therap

10. To elucidate the role of peptidoglycan in cell injury and death using Crohn disease (a GI inflammatory disease) and granulomatous syndromes as examples.

11. To discuss the impact of mutations in the NOD2 gene on the manifestation Crohn disease. Elaboration on new “co-conspirators”, autophagy genes and a ‘special’ virus, on development of Crohn Disease will also be made.

12. To elaborate on the importance of the Paneth cell in gut immunology defects in, and role in Crohn Disease.

13. To present the C-type lectin receptors and present an overview of their important role in antifungal immunity. 

14. To illustrate a major PAMP in fungi [(1-3)-?-D-glucan], describe its host cell receptor [Dectin-1], and describe the complex signaling associated with this fungal PAMP and disease.

15. To describe a rapid clinical test to detect invasive disease using (1-3)-?-D-glucan.

16. To review major fungi, recognize their morphology, and elaborate on the presence/absence of (1-3)-?-D-glucan (in class quiz)

17. To understand basic pathways of microbial pathogenesis and how selected components of  these pathways offer new targets for disease prevention or treatment instead of antibiotics
