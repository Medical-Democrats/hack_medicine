CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND REPAIR

OBJECTIVES: Upon completion of this section, the student will be able to:
1. Describe the morphologic features of a granuloma and give examples of diseases characterized by granulomatous inflammation.

2. Explain the systemic effects of inflammation, including fever, leukocytosis, and sepsis, in terms of mediators involved and their actions.

3. Classify cells into three classes based on their proliferative potential.

4. Discuss the cell cycle and elucidate points of control.  Describe the general features of the cyclin-CDK system and its role in cell growth. Discuss the role of RB and p53 in the cell cycle.

5. Describe the steps of tissue repair, including the cell types, cytokines, growth factors, and enzymes involved, and the approximate time table for the tissue repair process. Describe the role of various cell types involved in the process of wound healing. Compare healing by first intention and second intention in terms of time sequence of events, morphologic changes and final outcome. Describe the local and systemic factors that influence wound healing and list the complications.
