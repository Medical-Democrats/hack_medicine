GENETIC AND MOLECULAR BASIS OF CANCER

OBJECTIVES: Upon completion of this section, the student will be able to:

1. Discuss the relationship between protooncogenes and oncogenes, as well as the relationship between cellular oncogenes and viral oncogenes.


2. Compare and contrast oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, in terms of mechanisms of oncogenesis.


3. Explain the process of angiogenesis, delineate the importance of angiogenesis for substantial tumor growth, and describe the differences between native blood vessels and those formed via the process of tumor angiogenesis.


4. Discuss metastasis of malignant neoplasms, in terms of: 
a) molecular genetics
b) cellular adhesion
c) mechanisms of invasion of extracellular matrix
d) mechanisms of vascular dissemination and homing of tumor cells
e) tissues and organs in which metastases are: 
i. common 		
ii. uncommon


5. Define regulators of DNA repair, their mechanisms of action, and their role in tumorigenesis.

6. Describe the following cancer-susceptibility syndromes:            
a) Li-Fraumeni syndrome
b) ataxia-telangiectasia
c) xeroderma pigmentosum

in terms of:
i. genetic abnormality
ii. mechanisms of oncogenesis
iii. associated neoplasms
