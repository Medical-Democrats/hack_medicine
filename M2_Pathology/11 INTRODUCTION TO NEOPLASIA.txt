INTRODUCTION TO NEOPLASIA

      OBJECTIVES: Upon completion of this section, the student will be able to:
      
1. Outline the classification and nomenclature for benign, premalignant, and malignant neoplasms, using appropriate prefixes and suffixes and indicating specific exceptions to rules of nomenclature. Correlate nomenclature with macroscopic and microscopic morphology, and vice-versa


2. Enumerate the important clinical and pathologic distinctions between normal and neoplastic tissue


3. List the four major criteria that distinguish benign from malignant neoplasms, identifying|
a) the most reliable criterion for malignancy
b) the second most reliable criterion for malignancy


4. Discuss the four major pathways by which neoplasms spread


5. Compare and contrast carcinoma vs. sarcoma, in terms of tissue of origin, gross and microscopic features, and mode and rate of growth


6. Discuss the influence of occupational/environmental factors, age, and gender on variations and incidence of specific neoplasms


7. Discuss the relationship between each of the following and the development of malignant tumors
a) autosomal dominant inherited cancer syndromes
b) defective DNA repair syndromes
c) familial cancer syndromes
d) chronic inflammation
e) precancerous conditions
f) benign neoplasms
