2. With regard to the acute phase response, list: 
* the three major components of the response
* the factors operative in the pathogenesis of each component
* the use of these factors in laboratory testing


3. Name the diseases most closely associated with each of the following types of leukocytosis:
* neutrophilia
* lymphocytosis
* eosinophilia

4. Give three examples each of:
* diseases caused by excessive or inappropriate inflammatory host responses.
* diseases not thought to be primarily due to abnormal host responses, but in which     inflammation is thought to play a pathogenic role.


5. Differentiate between embryonic and adult (somatic) stem cells, and discuss the roles of stem cells in tissue maintenance and regeneration.


6. Solve case-based problems related to the objectives for this session.
