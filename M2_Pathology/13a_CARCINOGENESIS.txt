CARCINOGENESIS: CHEMICAL, RADIATION, MICROBIAL

OBJECTIVES:

1. Discuss the various causes and mechanisms (chemical, radiation and microbial) of carcinogenesis, in terms of:	
	* initiation & promotion
	* direct- vs. indirect-acting carcinogens
	* molecular target
	* induction of mutagenesis
	* induction of cell proliferation
	* cell susceptibility and manifestations

2. Contrast the mechanisms of carcinogenesis by DNA viruses with those by RNA viruses.
