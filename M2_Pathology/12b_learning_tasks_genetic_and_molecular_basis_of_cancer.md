	* telomere
	* transcription factor
	* transformation
	* translocation
	* tumor suppressor genes
	* tumorigenesis

2. List the regulatory mechanisms the loss of which may lead to cancer, and delineate the growth regulation pathways susceptible to modulation by oncogenes.

3. List the mechanisms of activation of oncogenes.

4. Describe the different types of products of oncogenes and their general mechanism in causing neoplastic changes.

5. Delineate the mechanisms involved in the regulation and execution of mammalian apoptosis, and explain the role, in the causation of human malignancy, of genes that regulate apoptosis.
 
6. Describe the role of telomerase in cancer.

7. Categorize regulators of angiogenesis into the following classes:
	* pro-angiogeneic factors
	* anti-angiogenic factors

8. Describe the following genes APC, bcl-2, bcr-abl, c-erb, B2, myc, p53, ras, Rb

	in terms of:
	* chromosomal location
	* mechanisms of oncogenesis
	* associated neoplasms

9. Discuss the following chromosomal translocations: t(8;14)(q24;q32), Burkitt lymphoma, t(9;22)(q34;q11), chronic myeloid leukemia

	in terms of:	
	* genes involved
	* mechanisms of oncogenesis
	* associated neoplasms

10. Discuss the regulation of gene expression by the following epigenetic changes:
DNA methylation, histone acetylation.

11. Describe miRNAs-mediated gene regulation
