HEMODYNAMIC DISORDERS, THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE,       AND SHOCK

INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Preview the Objectives, Learning Tasks, and Session Materials prior to class. Be sure that you are familiar with all of the words in Learning Task #1, because many of them will be used in class.

2. Review (as necessary to address the Objectives for this section) vascular physiology and normal hemostasis from your M1 year. 
OBECTIVES: upon completion of this section, the student will be able to:

1. Explain the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of edema, given a clinical scenario.

2. Compare edema of the various organs and tissues, including subcutaneous tissue, lungs, and brain on the basis of pathogenesis, morphologic changes and clinical consequences. Describe the gross findings in lungs with pulmonary edema.

3. Discuss the pathogenesis and clinical importance of hyperemia, congestion, and hemorrhage. Explain the relationship between congestion and edema, and congestion and hemorrhage.

4. Discuss common causes and clinical manifestations of acute and chronic hemorrhage.

5. Explain how each of the elements of the Virchow triad contribute to the formation of a thrombus, given a clinical case scenario. Compare and contrast arterial and venous thrombi, in terms of morphologic characteristics, sites of origin, predisposing factors, and clinical consequences. Describe the potential fate of a thrombus. 

6. Discuss disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in terms of etiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, lab diagnosis, complications and prognosis.
 
7. Distinguish between the various types of emboli given a clinical case scenario. Compare the various types of emboli (e.g. thromboemboli, air/gas, fat, tumor, amniotic fluid, bacteria/fungi) in terms of etiology, morphologic features, sites of occurence, complications, fate, and associated clinical manifestations. Compare and contrast pulmonary and systemic thromboembolism.

8. Explain the mechanism of infarction, factors influencing the severity of injury, and morphologic changes given a clinical case scenario.

9. Compare and contrast the pathophysiology, morphologic changes, treatment and prognosis of various types of shock. Describe the various stages of shock in terms of pathophysiology, morphologic changes and prognosis.

10. Describe the various stages of shock in terms of pathophysiology, morphologic changes and prognosis.

11. Compare and contrast the different types of shock
