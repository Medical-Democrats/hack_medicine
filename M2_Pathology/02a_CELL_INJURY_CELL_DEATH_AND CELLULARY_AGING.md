CELL INJURY, CELL DEATH, AND CELLULAR AGING

Objectives: the student will be able to:

1. Compare and contrast  hypertrophy, hyperplasia, atrophy, and metaplasia, in terms of etiology, pathogenesis, morphology, and possible outcomes. List examples of physiologic and pathologic hypertrophy and hyperplasia.

2. Describe the ultrastructural, light microscopic, and biochemical responses of the cell to reversible and irreversible injury. Diagram cellular events that occur in hypoxic cells. Describe cellular lesions that eventuate in cell death.
 
3. Compare and contast the following forms of cell injury: free radical injury, reperfusion injury, and chemical (toxic) injury, in terms of etiology, pathogenesis, morphology, and possible outcomes. 

4. Compare and contrast necrosis and apoptosis, including causes, biochemical pathways, morphologic features, and possible outcomes. List examples of physiologic and pathologic apoptosis.

5. Compare and contrast the following  patterns of necrosis: coagulation, liquefaction, enzymatic, caseous, gangrenous, and fibrinoid; distinguishing each from the others, and giving a typical example of each. Describe  gross and microscopic changes, as well as possible outcomes, of each type of  necrosis. 

6. Describe how endogenous and exogenous materials may accumulate in cells. Compare fatty change and fatty infiltration on the basis of their causes, pathogenesis, and organs commonly involved. Describe gross and microscopic findings in organs involved. Distinquish the pigments lipofuscin, melanin, carbon, bilirubin, and hemosiderin, telling how they appear grossly and microscopically.

7. Compare and contrast dystrophic and metastatic calcification in terms of definition, etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical significance. Tell how calcification may be recognized grossly, microscopically and radiographically.

8. Compare and contrast organismic and cellular aging, in terms of etiologic factors, pathogenesis, and effect on organism. 

9. List putative mechanisms which accelerate and which retard the rate of cellular aging.
