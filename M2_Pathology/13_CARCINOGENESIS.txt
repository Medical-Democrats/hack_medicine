CARCINOGENESIS: CHEMICAL, RADIATION, MICROBIAL
      OBJECTIVES: Upon completion of this section, the student will be able to:
1. 					Discuss the various causes and mechanisms (chemical, radiation and microbial) of carcinogenesis, in terms of:
* initiation & promotion 
* direct- vs. indirect-acting carcinogens 
* molecular target 
* induction of mutagenesis 
* induction of cell proliferation 
* cell susceptibility and manifestations

2. Contrast the mechanisms of carcinogenesis by DNA viruses with those by RNA viruses.
