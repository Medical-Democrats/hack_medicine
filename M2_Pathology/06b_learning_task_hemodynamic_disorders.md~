2. Describe acute and chronic passive congestion of each interms of a) morphologic features and b) functional alterations:
	* lungs
	* liver

3. Compare and contrast the morphologic appearance of in vivo thrombi vs. that of postmortem (postsurgical) clots

4. Compare and contrast: 
	* white (anemic) vs. red (hemorrhagic) infarcts 
	* septic vs. bland infarcts
     on the basis of:
a) etiology
b) pathogenesis
c) morphology
d) outcome


5. Solve case-based problems related to the objectives for this session.
