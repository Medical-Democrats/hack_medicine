Lecture 21 Basic Concept of Capillary Exchange
1) Explain how water and solutes traverse the capillary wall. Use Fick’s equation for diffusion to identify the factors that will affect the diffusion mediated delivery of nutrients from the capillaries to the tissues. Define and give examples of diffusion-limited and flow-limited exchange.
2) Describe how changes in capillary surface area affect the capacity for fluid exchange.
3) Know the major modes of transport across a capillary. How would most nutrients reach the cells?
4) Know and understand the meaning of the terms filtration and reflection coefficients. Describe how changes in these coefficients would affect the capacity for fluid exchange.
5) Define the Starling equation and discuss how each component influences fluid movement across the capillary wall.
6) Explain how diseases that reduce plasma albumin concentration lead to edema formation in the body.
7) Explain how changes in precapillary and postcapillary resistances can increase or decrease fluid movement out of capillaries how these changes may induce or attenuate edema formation.
8) Understand the main causes of edema.
