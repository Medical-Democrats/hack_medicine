II. DRUGS AFFECTING THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

1.0 Autonomic Nervous System: Describe the anatomical and biochemical
characteristics of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Explain the
physiological function of each of the identified receptor subtypes in these divisions.

1.1 Cholinergic Drugs: List the major cholinergic agonists and antagonists.
Distinguish between those affecting nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. Identify
agents affecting enzymatic degradation of acetylcholine. State the major
therapeutic applications of each prototype agents, and explain how its actions are
affected by each of the Basic Pharmacological Concepts.

1.2 Adrenergic Drugs: List the adrenergic agonists and antagonists, and
identify the receptor type(s) (and subtypes) upon which they act. State the major
therapeutic indications for each prototype agent and explain its actions in terms of
the Basic Pharmacological Concepts. List the adrenergic neuron blockers and
agents affecting monoamine metabolism with their therapeutic indications and
explain the pharmacological concepts regarding their application.

2.0 Drugs Affecting Neuromuscular Transmission: List drugs blocking
neuromuscular transmission, and classify them according to the nature of their
blocking action. List drugs facilitating neuromuscular transmission, and explain their
interactions with the blocking agents. Describe the pathophysiology of myasthenia
gravis, and explain the pharmacological principles of the drugs used in its treatment.

3.0 Local Anesthetics: Explain the ionic mechanism involved in blockade of
axon conduction by local anesthetics. Explain the selectivity of sensory blockade of
peripheral nerves by local anesthetics. List the two major chemical types of local
anesthetics and discuss the Basic Pharmacological Concepts governing their
actions.
