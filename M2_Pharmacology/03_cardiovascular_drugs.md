III. CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS

1. **Positive Inotropic Drugs**: List the prototype agents and describe their
application in terms of their actions in cardiac failure and tachyarrhythmias. Discuss
the Basic Pharmacological Concepts governing their use with special attention to
toxic side effects.

2. **Antiarrhythmic Drugs**: Discuss the conduction abnormalities involved in
various arrhythmias, list the drugs useful in treatment of arrhythmia and discuss the
terms of their mechanism of action in atrial fibrillation and flutter, paroxysmal
supraventricular tachycardia and premature systoles. Describe the emergency
management of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. For each prototype agent,
explain the Basic Pharmacological Concepts involved in its applications. 

3. **Antianginal Agents and Calcium Antagonists**: List the drug useful in
management of angina and explain their mechanisms in terms of actions on smooth
muscle, receptors or ionic conductances. Explain the Basic Pharmacological
Concepts governing the application of each agent.

4. **Anti-Atherosclerotic Drugs**: Describe the metabolic pathways involved in
the hyperlipidemias (Types II to V). List agents affecting lipid metabolism and the
principles governing their applications.

5. **Drugs Affecting Bleeding and Thrombosis**: List the drugs effective in
preventing blood coagulation, categorize by mechanism of action, and describe the
Basic Pharmacological Concepts governing their application. List the agents
available for lysis of thrombi, and describe the concepts governing their
applications.
