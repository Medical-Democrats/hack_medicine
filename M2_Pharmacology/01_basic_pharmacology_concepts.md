I. BASIC PHARMACOLOGICAL CONCEPTS OR PRINCIPLES

1. **Chemistry**: Describe chemical properties useful for understanding how
drugs cross membranes, and distribute in the body. Identify characteristics useful
for predicting actions, toxicities or route(s) of metabolism and excretion.

2. **Absorption, Distribution and Elimination**: Describe the effects of
lipid/water solubility and ionization on drug absorption. Explain how protein binding
and lipid solubility affect drug distribution. List the routes of administration, and
discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Describe the various metabolic
reactions and excretory processes which effect drug elimination.

3. **Indications**: Describe the mechanism(s) by which the agent under
discussion exerts its biological effects. Identify, when possible, the specific receptor
sites involved, and metabolic or physiological processes that are altered. From this
understanding, explain its potential therapeutic applications.

4. **Adverse Effects**: Identify the dose-related adverse effects for each agent
and state the concept of the therapeutic index. Distinguish between idiosyncratic
reactions and hypersensitivity. Describe any identified pharmacogenetic or
mutagenic factors affecting the action of the prototypic drug. Also state
mechanisms of major drug/drug interactions. Identify any problems with drug
tolerance, withdrawal or drug-seeking behavior.

5. **Contraindications**: Identify any conditions such as pre-existing disease,
age related changes in body function or pregnancy which predictably alter response
or constitute an unacceptable risk for use of the agent under consideration.
