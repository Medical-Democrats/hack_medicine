VI. DRUGS ACTING ON THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

1. **General Anesthetics**: List the widely used inhalational and injectable
anesthetic agents and compare them with respect to potency, induction time,
recovery time, depth of anesthesia, intensity of analgesia, cardiovascular and
muscle relaxant effects. For each representative type agent, explain how its actions
are affected by the Basic Pharmacological Concepts.

2. **Hypnotics and Sedatives**: List the widely used sedative-hypnotic drug
classes and their prototype representatives. Describe the receptor systems
presently identified as affected by these agents. Compare their effects on sleep
stages and respiration, and their propensity to produce tolerance. Explain how the
Basic Pharmacology Concepts affect the application of each prototype agent.

3. **Alcohols**: Describe the actions of ethanol in terms of each of the Basic
Pharmacological Concepts with special attention to the factors affecting its
pharmacokinetics. Explain the metabolic factors responsible for the toxicity of
methanol and ethylene glycol and methods of pharmacological treatment.

4. **Antipsychotic Agents**: Describe the major dopaminergic pathways of the
brain and explain how each pathway is affected by the antipsychotic agents. List
the major prototype antipsychotic drugs, and explain how the action of each is
affected by the Basic Pharmacological Concepts. Detail the potential side effects of
rapid neuroleptization and chronic administration.

5. **Antidepressants and Lithium**: List the major classes of antidepressant
agents, and describe their basic mechanisms of action. Identify prototypic agents
from each class, and discuss how the Basic Pharmacological Concepts affect the
application of these agents. Discuss the special pharmacokinetic and toxicity
problems of lithium.

6. **Antianxiety Agents**: Describe the major pharmacological applications of
the antianxiety agents, and identify the receptor subtypes involved. Discuss the
pharmacokinetic differences between the prototype agents, and their potential side
effects, toxicities and tendency towards tolerance.

7. **Antiepileptic Agents**: Describe the major types of seizures, and list the
prototype agents useful in their management. For each agent, discuss the
pharmacokinetic principles, toxicities and contraindications which govern its
application. Of special interest are drug interactions, therapeutic monitoring issues
and chronic administration problems.

8. **Drugs Affecting Extrapyramidal Motor System**: Describe the anatomical
and biochemical factors involved in extrapyramidal motor disorders. List the agents
useful in the management of Parkinson’s disease, and discuss their mechanism(s)
of action. Explain how the actions of each compound are affected by the Basic
Pharmacological Concepts. Identify agents which can cause choreiform activity,
and agents which alleviate it. Describe the potential effects of chronic
administration of these agents.

9. **Opioid Analgesics and Antagonists**: Identify the opiate receptors types,
and identify how their agonists affect behavior. List the prototype agents available
for pain management, describe how they compare or differ from morphine in their
basic pharmacological actions. Explain the development of tolerance and physical
dependence with these agents, and identify their relative abuse liability. List the
available antagonists and explain their actions in terms of the Basic
Pharmacological Concepts.

10. **Central Stimulant, Anorexic and Analeptic Agents**: Describe the actions,
effects and applications of the amphetamines. Discuss their potential side effects,
toxicities and management. Explain the development of tolerance and physical
dependence with these agents. List prototype agents of non-amphetamine classes
of stimulants, anorexics and analeptic agents and briefly discuss their actions and
effects.

11. **Hallucinogens**: List the major classes of hallucinogens and describe their
basic mechanisms of action. Identify prototypic agents from each class and
compare their effects and toxicities, and explain their management.

12. **Drug Abuse**: This topic is dealt with under each use category in which it is
considered. However, in view of the extensive problems involving the non-medical
use of centrally acting drugs, special attention is focused on this issue. Discuss the
roles of tolerance, physical dependence, and drug-seeking behavior in drug abuse.
Discuss the current models explaining drug abuse behavior. List the major agents
involved in drug abuse, and compare the physiological and behavioral
consequences of their abuse.
