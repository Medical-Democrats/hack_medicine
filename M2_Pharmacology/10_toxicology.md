X. TOXICOLOGY

The toxicity of therapeutic agents and antidotal therapy is covered as each agent is
discussed. The list of potential toxic agents, not used medically, is enormous.
However, because of the relatively high incidence of certain chemical exposures,
there is a need to understand the toxicity of carbon monoxide, cyanide, lead (and
other heavy metals), organophosphates and carbonates, pesticides and special
industrial solvents.
