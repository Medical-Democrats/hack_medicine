Each folder is prefixed with M1 or M2, indicating the level of the material. For example, you would study M1 material before M2 material. \r\n\r\nWithin each folder, you will find a numerical list of lectures in Markdown text files. Each lecture may be broken down into learning objectives, learning tasks, and possibly resources containing relevant readings. As you may have guessed, the learning objectives are based on accredited standards set by accrediting/accredited bodies.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal for now is to make the first two years of medical school open while maintaining quality.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n----\r\n\r\nCurrently medical education sits behind an ivy wall. I believe it should be democratized. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the first two years (the M1 and M2 years) of medical education is most conducive to being open. This is the basic medical sciences and is the focus of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 (there are 3). The M1-M2 years form the educational foundation upon which the rest of a medical career is built upon. By making it open, anyone who is interested, passionate, and persistent can attain the same educational foundation.\r\n\r\nMedical schools are accredited by governing bodies, and the curriculum they provide must follow certain guidelines or standardization. This means that students from Harvard to insert-medical-school-name-here are learning the same basic medical sciences. After all, students from the 130+ medical schools in the nation must take the same national USMLE Step 1 exam!\r\n\r\nYou can read more at my blog [Zafarian](http://zafarian.tumblr.com/).\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: While anyone can study the **basic** medical science of medical curricula, not everyone can practice as a physician. For that, each student has to earn the privilege to gain entry and develop skills and experience in the all-important clinical years.\r\n\r\nWhy Git?\r\n---------\r\n\r\nGit can store and track the medical curriculum. Self-motivated students can follow the curriculum. Medical educators can fork or pull the curriculum and enhance it. Moreover, developers can design apps on top of the curriculum, further democratizing medical education. Github can serve as the social glue connecting students, educators and developers!\r\n\r\nContact\r\n--------\r\n\r\nTwitter: @AleemZa\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
